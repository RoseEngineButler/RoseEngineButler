#
# LinuxCNC configuration for use with a Rose Engine
#
# File:
#   REB_Update.sh
#
# Purpose:
#   This updates the files pulled from GitHub.
#
# End User Customisation:
#   THE END USER OF THE ROSE ENGINE BUTLER SYSTEM SHOULD NOT MODIFY
#   THIS FILE.
#
#   Changes to this file are not supported by Colvin Tools nor
#   Brainwave Embedded.
#
# Version
#   1.0 - 27 Oct 2025, R. Colvin
#   1.1 - 23 Dec 2025, R. Colvin - Changed text from "upgrade" to
#         "update".
#   1.2 - 22 January 2026, R. Colvin - Updated to run on Debian 13
#             Trixie: updated directories from
#                /home/reuben/
#             to
#                /home/reuben/
#   1.3 - 27 July 2026, R. Colvin - The repo remote moved from HTTPS
#             to SSH, authenticated with the reuben user's SSH key.
#             Dropped sudo from the git commands so pull/stash run as
#             reuben (whose key is registered with GitHub) instead of
#             root (which has no key and would fail publickey auth).
#   1.4 - 08 October 2026 - Refreshes the EtherLab package source's
#             signing key before "apt update" (see below): its copy
#             expired 20 September 2026, which made apt update warn.
